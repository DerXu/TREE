Currently, only available double precision real numbers.
Because some contractions are not consistent with conjugation, extending to complex numbers is somewhat tough, e.g. real-time evolution, etc...

Site design is not good...
I don't have the object for total wave and/or operator, such like MPS and MPO classes in mpsxx.
This is from technical issue to design TNS and/or TNO objects.
